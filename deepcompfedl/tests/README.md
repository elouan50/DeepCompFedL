# Tests

Files implemented in this folder aim to test the implemented features of the project. The "tests" are divided in multiple sections :
- Free tests
- Unit tests
- Functional tests
that we will describe below.

## Free tests
These aren't proper tests as from a computer science point of view. They only aim to give a better understanding of how things work for neural networks in pytorch, and set up a sandbox for developing new features.
The name of each of these files is more or less descriptive, nethertheless they all provide a description at the beginning. That includes:
```
free
 ├── distribution.py
 ├── path.py
 ├── saveandzip.py
 ├── sizeofmodel.py
```

## Unit tests
Some of the methods and classes developed during this project are individually evaluated. That includes:
```
unit
 ├── compression.py
```

## Functional tests
Some of the methods and classes developed during this project are individually evaluated. It is yet empty:
```
